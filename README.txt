i learned how to use Sass, so please review the styles.sccs file instead of the styles.css file.
furthermore, here are my design decisions:
i wanted 2 colors (not just one) to make the site "stand out"/be interesing/nice to look at. and in order to have 2 agreeing colors, i chose the complemantary colourscheme, with hue 180 degrees apart. i thought the orange does give a nice warm feeling for the image of the students reading in sunshine. blue is good for education i thought. that's why the info stuff is blue and the orange effects are 'eye candy'. (i am aware that some contrasts are not optimal). furthermore, i tried to have a general 'from bright to dark'-scheme on the webpage, i.e. bright header, medium body and dark footer. please leave a comment on the design.
furthermore, i tried to have similar behaviour, e.g. the buttons in the menu behave the same as the "start learning" button. the user shouldn't be irritated that parts look/behave different than other part of the page. please leave a comment on that too: did i achieve that goal?
i also added a few questinos in the html document.
the project was a lot of fun and i learned a lot!!! thanx!!
